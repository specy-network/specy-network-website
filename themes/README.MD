Agnes is a Landing Page theme ported from the free HTML template created by <a href="https://onepagelove.com/agnes">Tailwind Templates</a>. It has been ported to Hugo by Debashish. The design is lovely and features an intro screenshot preview area, product/service feature list and ends with three-tier pricing table.

# Getting started
We are assuming that you have already installed Hugo on your computer [follow the Quick start guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) if not.

## Create your Hugo website
```
hugo new site my_website
cd my_website
```

## Adding theme to your website
There are two ways to add the theme to your Hugo website. 

### Method 1: Without involving Git (Easier)
* Download the Agnes theme as a Zip file from https://github.com/dchucks/agnes-hugo-theme/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
* Create a sub-folder "Agnes" under the "Themes" folder.
```
cd themes
mkdir Agnes
```
* Unzip the zip file and copy all the files and folders (from the folder where the README.md file resides) to the Agnes folder.
* Now test if the theme is working, as follows, and your site should be running at http://localhost:1313/
```
cd Agnes/exampleSite/*
hugo server --themesDir ../..
```

### Method 2: With Git (needs Git knowledge)
* Clone the theme repository
```
git clone https://github.com/dchucks/agnes-hugo-theme.git Agnes
```
* Copy the example site 
```
cp -r Agnes/* my_website/themes
```
* Navigate to your website, and initialize an empty Git repository in the directory.
```
cd my_website
git init
```
* Add Agnes theme as a submodule and update the site configuration file for the current theme.
```
git submodule add -f https://github.com/dchucks/agnes-hugo-theme.git ./themes/Agnes
echo "theme = 'Agnes'" >> hugo.toml
```
* Start the dev server, your site should be running at http://localhost:1313/
```
hugo server
```

### Example config.toml
An example site [Config file](https://github.com/dchucks/agnes-hugo-theme/blob/main/exampleSite/config.toml) can be found under the theme's `exampleSite` folder. Just update the content in the file relevent to your website and you should be done.
